Here, you will learn about how to use all of what thenewboston-js has to offer. If you notice an error or typo, then please create a pull request yourself and we can pull in the changes to save everyone some time.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to use the library.

- Clone the repository / download the files and load them into your project.
- Using NPM `npm install thenewboston `, this will install the library to your package.json file

> For simplicity, we will not be including `import` or `require` statements in our examples.
